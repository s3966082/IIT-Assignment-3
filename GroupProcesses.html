    <h1>Group Processes</h1>
</html>
<p>A majority of the jobs within our group are correlated within the IT sector with only a couple of group members interested in something that is out of its grasp. This includes Johnny who desires to be an investment analyst and Divyanshi who wants to be a digital analytics specialist. In contrast the rest of the team are aiming for jobs in the IT sector, more specifically, Tanmay wanting to be an application architect, Gazi wanting to be a database administrator, Asfandyar wanting to be a software engineer and Georgie wanting to do IT consulting. A common element amongst the team members here is that nearly if not all these jobs require you to work with others and hence once again working within a team setting. Furthermore, what differentiates the jobs from the others, especially the ones in the IT field, is that they all correlate to a different sector of IT. For an example Georgie and Gazi both are looking to obtain a job in the IT field, yet because of how extensive and large the IT                          field is, Georgies job relates to programming, whilst Gazis relates more to managing databases, showing that although two jobs or in our groups cases multiple jobs are within the same category they are still widely different from one another. This then correlates into showing how similar yet different everyone's careers plans are, with the clear differences being the people who chose jobs out of the IT field, but this also reveals the clear differences that can be shown for the remainder of the group who all chose jobs in the IT field. <p class="lastparagraph">
