    <h1>Aims</h1>
        <h2>Overall aim of our project</h2>
            <p>The overall aim of our project is to develop a software that can help the users to determine empty parking spots around a vicinity.
The main aim behind the software that we are developing is to make the lives of both the drivers and the Traffic control department a little easier. We are hoping that through the help of our software:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The drivers will be able to save money, fuel and time from driving around aimlessly looking for parking spots in a congested area.
</li>
        <li>The drivers will be able to Save 15-20 minutes of their day by not leaving their homes early in order to search for parking spots.
</li>
        <li>They will also be able to avoid congested areas to park which will be more convenient for a far more smoother drive and less chances of collision. This will also result in helping the traffic control department and the government.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>smaller goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>	Organising and distributing tasks: At the start of our project it is going to be our main goal to decide who is going to handle what part of our project and how we are going to work together as a team to ace our project. This should be a key goal in any project so that things run smoothly in the future and no one collides with one another just like the cars in a congested parking spot.
</li>
            <li>	Coming up with a layout of the artefact: Before actually starting to build the artefact we want to come up with a layout of how we think the software is going to work. This will kind of be like a blueprint which everyone can take a look at and give their opinions. This is very important because when the software is completed it will be harder for changes to be made according to everyoneâ€™s taste. It's crucial for everyone to approve the blueprint so that we can proceed.
</li>
            <li>	Start creation of our artifact: Now that everyone has approved the concept and we have a direction to go into , its time for us to finally start building the artifact. We hope to get it done as soon as possible so that finishing touches can be made before the deadline.
</li>
            <li>Hold more and more meetings: The most crucial goal is going to be to hold as many meetings as we can. We want to stay in constant touch so that there is always a sense of understanding about what the current progress of our project is. After our previous assignment we have drawn a conclusion that communication is going to be key if we want good grades in our assignment.
</li>
            <li>Finishing touches: Our final goal is going to be to have everything completed and displayed on our website at least 1-2 days before the deadline. It is important to set this goal to avoid last minute hassles and a smoother submission.
</li>
            <li>Start thinking about the presentation : We aim to start the foundation process of our presentation as soon as we complete our website. The sooner we start the better our presentation is going to be. For the presentation process we are aiming to hold  physical meetings so that the results are better.
