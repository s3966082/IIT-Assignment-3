    <h1>Plans and Progress</h1>

    <h2>Week 9</h2>

    <p>
        This week our group began the planning stages of the entire project. It was hard at first to do so because many members of our group were not present for the class.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 10</h2>

    <p>
        As a much needed improvement from the last assignment, most people were very responsive with organising a meeting to decide what we would be doing in our project and who would be doing what. We have decided to change our project idea moving forward from the last assignment as we felt we needed a change. We also brainstormed some ideas for other projects but found that we had some good ideas for artifacts for this particular one. For our project we decided to go with Asfandyar’s assignment 1 project which is an app which connects to cameras around the city/country (yet to be fully determined) to suggest free carparks to the user. We have decided that for artifacts we will be making a mockup, that is hopefully interactive, that will show how the application will look. We have assigned all sections of the assignments to group members and hope to all work on this project evenly.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 11</h2>

    <p>
        This week we decided that our artifact would have to be completed in class time and so have pushed back the designing of it until our last class, which is in week 12. This may be a bit of a challenge as it leaves us with little time to actually complete it, however we have weighed up all options, such as one person designing it or designing it together on a Microsoft Teams call, but we have come to the conclusion that this will be the best way to do it. This is because it ensures presence of group members and it should just be easier in general to create something together when we are in-person with one another.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 12</h2>

    <p>
        This week is when we set our final deadline for getting all the content completed for this assignment. It seems to be going well so far. In terms of communication, our group seems to be doing much better this time around and everyone seems to be relatively responsive. Provided everyone gets their content done by this week we should be able to start creating the website to input all our information. This week is also the week that we have decided to design our artifact, an interactive mock-up of our proposed app. Unfortunately due to some adverse weather conditions and other unlucky situations, the whole group wasn’t able to attend class this week and so we had to move our creation of the artifact to a teams call later on. As it was Asfandyar’s original project, he took the lead in the design of this app and it went very smoothly
    </p>

    <h2>Week 13</h2>

    <p class="lastparagraph">
        This week for us is just putting the final touches on everything. 90% of our content is done and it has been very smooth sailing for most of the assignment. It has become apparent how well the team is doing compared to the last assignment. Communication is better, people are putting in more effort to make sure their parts are done on time and everyone is showing up to meetings. The website is being made this week and since we are using the same template as the last assignment it has been relatively easy. It seems that we should be able to get everything done and submitted to a high standard by the due date with how we are going so far.
