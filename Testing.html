    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <p>Testing is required in any project to provide developers insight on what tweaks or bugs are still hiding in their project and allows them to fix it before delivering their final project to their clients, testing ensures that our final project is reliable and is safe for our users to operate. As our final goal is to integrate our software into all global cctv cameras to allow everyone to use it, we will have to start with a small batch such as a few shopping centre carparks to ensure that our system works as we anticipate. As stated previously, we want to make it easier and faster for people to find parking without the risk of collision with other drivers, so we would consider it a success if our beta testers are able to find parking within a designated time such as 10 minutes and are able to use our interface without any bugs such as a parking spot being open when there isnt any. Additionally, a clear indicator that we have succeeded would be when we have integrated our software into majority of cctv cameras around the world as it would indicate that our software is useful and beneficial to all businesses and individuals around the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We will be testing our software at everypoint within the development to ensure that it is working as intended, as our project is still in early stages of development, we will start with a small batch of testers to ensure that bugs are discovered and fixed before allowing a large amount of people to test/use it. There isnt a specific requirement to become a tester as our end goal is to have everyone to use it and as such we will allow a wide range of people to become testers to ensure that our software works in all vechicles and in a whole range of scenarios such as on rainy days, days that have fog and sunny days.</p>
