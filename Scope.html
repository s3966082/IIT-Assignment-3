    <h1>Scopes and limits</h1>
</html>
<p>Like anything that brings innovation including this software there will always be some limitations that come along with it further down the track. More specifically focusing on this software, there are many simple aspects of it that can be overlooked which then begin to bring in its limitations. The main one being, because this software system relies on scanning the parking number, to see if the parking spot is empty or not (if the parking number is scanned it is empty, if it is covered it isnâ€™t) there may be some things that could prevent this from occurring as normal. The first being random objects covering the parking numbers, this may be a shopping trolly, a person standing over the parking number, birds sitting on or around the parking number, etc. Because of this the software and thus the camera will be unable to accurately scan the parking number and because it is covered by something that is not a car, regardless it will still show up as the parking spot being used/taken via the app it reports to. Other factors that also limit this software once again relate to the use of parking numbers. Parking numbers are put onto the ground via paint, and because of harsh weather, rain and a number of other factors it will all eventually contribute to the fading away of the numbers hence once again preventing the camera from scanning it accurately to tell whether the parking spot is empty or not. This can however be prevented and reduced by allocating specific check ups and repaints for the parking numbers, and in general to ensure the parking numbers are still clearly visible and nothing other than a car is overshadowing/covering the parking number. <p class="lastparagraph">
