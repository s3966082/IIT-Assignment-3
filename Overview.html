    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <h2>Topic</h2>
    <p>
      The topic of our project involves a software that can be consolidated into Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) for all the bustling parking spots such as in CBDs across the globe. As we're aware, finding a parking spot in crowded places, especially during peak season is challenging. This also often leads to unnecessary wastage of time and fuel looking for a spot, parking at wrong spots that block the way for other cars, crashes due to pointless driving and tailback.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      This software is going to solve all the above stated issues by combining in CCTV and then scanning the empty parking spots by a unique number that will be detected and eventually can be directed on a locating application, say, Google Maps. This way, people would automatically know the available parking spots at their destination and eradicate the stress and hassle of finding a safe spot for their car.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      The motivation of our project comes from an amalgamation of personal experiences and the relevant study. This is a kind of situation
which all of us have faced or know people who have faced at some point of time. Thinking of what IT can do in such is a situation is the motivation behind this project. This user-friendly software would help heaps of people by saving their time and energy and make their life easier and help conserve the environment by saving fuel.
    </p>
    <h2>Landscape</h2>
    <p>
      There are billions of CCTV cameras around the bustling areas and parking spots. Other than for safety, they can also be put to this use as they are a major element of this project. With their and the parking numbers' help, we can easily set up our software. Once the software and the cameras around CBDs or congested areas are merged, we can provide the unique numbers to the parking spaces by painting on the floor, so that it is easily spotted in the camera. Once that's done, it can pop up on the app and then forwarded to a GPS system such as Google Maps which will lead to the exact same spot and hence no aimless driving. It can be accessible globally to all the CBD regions where parking is a major issue among drivers, say Melbourne CBD, New York CBD, Sydney CBD, etc. This is a convenient situation in most cases but say, if the unique number is covered by something (a trolley or a paper)
and the CCTV is not able to catch the number, it is going to show the unavailability of the spot. All in all, formulating and working on the project and the anticipated shortcomings is going to help in building skills and of course the public.
