    <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
    <p> The first important thing to look at is the app design. Making an overcomplicated app might not help us draw in customers. So, we can use simple UI and UX designs. The app must also support location services, to point out empty parking spots. In order to do so, we must use GPS tracking to ensure we get an approximate idea about distances. The app should also have payment options, so we can make use of the NFC functionality and other online payment portals. The app must also be able to send Push Notifications, this can be done by introducing push notification tools. OS version controls matter as well. So, the application should optimized properly so that they work well under the different OS environments. Since this application will contain a lot of personal informations, for added security, 2FA should also be used. It must have a smart calculator which will help us show more accurate times/distances. This app should also have heatmaps for the viewers to check the busiest places. The software should also help us find out parking spots in real-time by connecting the camera to the app and giving out directions on where to go and park. To achieve this, we can use programming languages such as python to detect and analyse free parking areas in real time. </p>
