    <h1>Group Reflection</h1>

        I think this assignment went a lot smoother than our last one. A lot of this is due to team members being a lot more communicative and responsive than last time. Although some parts were still being completed up to the deadline, most of the work got done in a timely manner. Perhaps next time we might be a bit more organised with getting everything done a bit earlier so we have more time to polish it all up. I was surprised though, with how much our group kind of turned around from last assignment in terms of our communication. Although it was the same people organising most of the assignment, the rest of the group still was a lot better with their communication. Something that I have learnt about groups is how best to organise everything. This includes meetings, deadlines and content distribution.

        This assignment has gone extremely better than the previous assignment, we had more communication and more of our team members attended the meetings which helped everyone grasp how long it should take to complete the assignment. Although communication had improved, there was still team members who came to the meetings however didnt respond to messages on discord and microsoft teams which made it difficult to know how much they have done and how much they have left to do within our deadline. What i learnt when being apart of this groups is how essential it is to plan and put soft deadlines on tasks, this encourages team members to uphold their responsibilities and ensures that they do the parts that are assigned to them.

         This assignment was better than the previous one. People communicated with eachother more and everyone attended the meetings so Iâ€™d say the main issue regarding the previous assignment was solved. Although it was better, some were still hard to reach out to. But it all worked out in the end.
