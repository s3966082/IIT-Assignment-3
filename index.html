        ​​My name is Johnny Dang, I am 20 years old and I’m in my third year studying Bachelor of Economics and Finance. My background is Vietnamese and in my free time I like to analyse the market which may sound boring but it’s actually quite fun, I also started to leverage trade which is very risky as you can lose a lot of money but that’s what makes it fun as you can also make a lot of money. I also like to go out with my friends to eat and have some fun. My interest in IT began when the 2021 cryptocurrency craze began, and I was beginning to research and learn about what the blockchain was. What I found interesting about the blockchain was how it worked. I do not have any other prior IT experience as I have not done any IT subjects back in high school nor in university.

        My name is Divyanshi Bhasin. I am 18 and I’m in my first year pursuing a Bachelor in IT. I am from India. My forte is swimming and I’ve won several laurels in that. I completed my high school in 2022 and secured High Distinction in grade 12. I can read and speak English and Hindi fluently. I own a pet dog whose name is Shiro. He’s one year old and I miss him the most here. My interest in IT started way back when I was in middle school. I was introduced to the computer language and programming for the first time then. The Internet and networks would always trigger my curiosity and made me question how an invisible thing can transfer data, perform bank transfers, and communicate with people who live poles apart. I consider myself still a beginner at it and hence chose this course after my high school to dig deep in this field and learn more about it.

        Hi, my name is Tanmay Jain. I’m currently pursuing a bachelor of computer science at Royal Melbourne institute of technology .
        I am 19 years of age and I was born and bred in India. I am an extroverted person who likes making new friends constantly. Coming to Melbourne for my higher education was a challenge by I am enjoying myself here.
        In my free time I like going out with my friends and playing video games like rocket league and apex . My interest for IT spewed last year when I rode the massive wave of NFTs and blockchain. I have successfully launched 2 nft projects and I have never had so much fun doing an activity which also gave me a substantial economic benefit. I am doing this course to enhance my skillset and also because I love anything related to technology. My latest interest has been learning new programming languages. I am trying my best to balance my academic and social life.

        Hey guys, my name is Gazi, I am from Bangladesh. Usually in my free time, I play video games like Call of Duty, FIFA and GTA online with my friends. I love going to the gym and eating out. I have two dogs back in Bangladesh, one is named CoCo and another Berry. Growing up I used to watch a lot of Batman and used to love his gadgets and was always into Sci-Fi that’s how I started growing interest in tech. I am still a newbie but am not struggling learning all the different languages. I do not why, but I kinda like coding.

        For those who don’t know me my name is Asfandyar Khan, otherwise also known as Asfi. I’d describe myself to you but please bear with me, as the person I am largely fluctuates depending on the weather, the day of the week and what I ate for breakfast. Now onto my nationality which is as confusing as me, I’m Pashtun which isn’t exactly a nationality but refers to my ethnicity as Afghan, however due to the wonderful state of that country right now my entire family for the last 45 years have been residing in Pakistan, meaning I speak Pashto, Urdu and English fluently, talk about a bilingual king am I right? More about me is that I love travelling, with hopefully my upcoming destinations being Istanbul, Dubai and Geneva and am largely passionate about anything that has to do with consuming food!

        My name is Georgie, I’m 20 years old and I am a first-year student in the Bachelor of IT. I did two years of a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in History, at the University of Melbourne before moving to RMIT but felt I had no career opportunities in the field. In my free time I enjoy playing netball and playing video games. I enjoy PC games like Valorant and Portal as well as Nintendo games like Breath of the Wild and Mario games. I live in a big household of seven people, with my three siblings, two parents and one-year-old nephew. I have one pet at home, a 2-year-old tabby cat, her name is Ash, named after the main character of the Pokémon anime series. I have a little experience in programming, with languages like Python and Autohotkey, as well as computer hardware (building my own computer), but I still feel very much like a beginner in the IT field.

    <h2>Group Processes</h2>

    <p>
        At the beginning of the second assignment communication was lacking a lot which made it difficult to get some things done. However, towards the end, it got a little better and we were able to complete our assignment to a good standard. This time around we will hold meetings more regularly and try to ensure that we keep good communication with one another.
    </p>

    <h2>Career Plans</h2>

    <p class="lastparagraph">
        A majority of the jobs within our group are correlated within the IT sector with only a couple of group members interested in something that is out of its grasp. This includes Johnny who desires to be an investment analyst and Divyanshi who wants to be a digital analytics specialist. In contrast the rest of the team are aiming for jobs in the IT sector, more specifically, Tanmay wanting to be an application architect, Gazi wanting to be a database administrator, Asfandyar wanting to be a software engineer and Georgie wanting to do IT consulting. A common element amongst the team members here is that nearly if not all these jobs require you to work with others and hence once again working within a team setting. Furthermore, what differentiates the jobs from the others, especially the ones in the IT field, is that they all correlate to a different sector of IT. For an example Georgie and Gazi both are looking to obtain a job in the IT field, yet because of how extensive and large the IT                          field is, Georgies job relates to programming, whilst Gazis relates more to managing databases, showing that although two jobs or in our groups cases multiple jobs are within the same category they are still widely different from one another. This then correlates into showing how similar yet different everyone's careers plans are, with the clear differences being the people who chose jobs out of the IT field, but this also reveals the clear differences that can be shown for the remainder of the group who all chose jobs in the IT field.
