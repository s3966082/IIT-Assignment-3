    <h1>Risks</h1>
</html>
<p> Perhaps the only and biggest risk that poses against developing and integrating this software is the benefit to cost ratio it provides. One thing that everyone has to remember is that almost everything is subjective. From an idea, a person, an innovation, an invention almost every person will look and think about it differently including its positives and negatives. In this care some people may find that this software is very helpful to them, as they are the consumers using it. It is now easier for them to find parking, theyâ€™re burning less fuel, they get to their places on time, but on the contrary the governments and companies may not find that the software is worth it. That in the grand scheme of things it does not help much by saving some time and fuel for the people driving within densely populated areas. Acknowledging that despite the software being developed or not and ready to be integrated within camera systems, it will be both costly and time consuming, showing that the greatest risk is the level of support this software gains. The only way to help its cause is by showing that its positives outweigh its negatives. <p class="lastparagraph">
