    <h1>Timeframe</h1>
    <h2>Week 9</h2>

    <p>
        This week, we have started designating work to all members of our team however some of our members were not able to join the team meeting and as such we were unable to designate all the tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 10</h2>

    <p>
        We had another meeting discussing which tasks each member was doing. Similar to last week, some of our team members were not present at the meeting and due to this we had to designate tasks to them without discussing it with them. We agreed that the tasks that were designated to each team member should be done by the end of this week and agreed that it should only take each team member up to 6 hours to finish their tasks as it was similar to assessment 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny: Testing and Time frame 5 hours
      <br>
      Asfandyar: Scopes and limits, Risk 5-6 hours
      <br>
      Georgie: Skills and jobs, plans and progress 5-6 hours
      <br>
      Gazi: Tools and Technology 3-4 hours
      <br>
      Tanmay: Aims and Roles 4 hours
    </p>

    <h2>Week 11</h2>

    <p>
      Asfandyar took initiative to do the artifact as it was his project and he knew what the artifacts should look like. We agreed that one person should do the artifact as there was no point in having the whole group present when making the artifact if it can only be done on one computer. The whole group agreed that the artifact should only take a few hours to do and should be done by the beginning of week 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to getting a high score on the previous assignment when it came to formatting, we agreed to use georgies website and agreed that it should only take a hour or two to set up the website so that everyone else can start putting their work into it.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 12</h2>
    <p>
      This meeting we agreed that the tasks deadline should be pushed by from friday to sunday as some of our team members were not able to access the documents and were unable to do their part. As these tasks were similar to the previous assignment we agreed that it should only take 4-5 hours to complete their task and as such should only take 2 at most to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As agreed by everyone within the group, all tasks and artifacts were completed by week 12 and only thing left to do was double checking work which would only take 1-2 hours to do.
